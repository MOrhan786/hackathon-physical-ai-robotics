# Prompt

my home page which is Physical AI plz chang colur them more attractive and some changing which is more better ui (user interface   )and also good

# Response

Created a comprehensive specification for the Physical AI home page UI improvement feature. The specification includes:

- User scenarios with priorities (P1-P2) focusing on visual appeal, UI elements, and user experience
- Functional requirements covering color scheme, layout, typography, interactive elements, and accessibility
- Key entities: Home Page and UI Components
- Edge cases for different devices, accessibility, performance, and browser compatibility
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes (time spent, satisfaction rating, bounce rate, etc.)

The specification addresses the user's request to make the Physical AI home page more visually attractive with improved UI elements while maintaining existing functionality. Two clarifications were resolved with reasonable defaults (WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and preserving content structure).
