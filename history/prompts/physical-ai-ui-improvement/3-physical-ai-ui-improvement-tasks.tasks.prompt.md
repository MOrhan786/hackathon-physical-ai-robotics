# Prompt

to generate specific, actionable tasks for implementing these UI improvements.

# Response

Generated a comprehensive task list for implementing the Physical AI home page UI improvements. The tasks are organized in phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (environment and directory creation)
- Phase 2: Foundational Styling (CSS variables, typography, accessibility)
- Phase 3: [US1] Enhanced Visual Appeal (color scheme, visual elements)
- Phase 4: [US2] Improved User Interface Elements (buttons, cards, navigation)
- Phase 5: [US3] Enhanced User Experience (navigation, content presentation)
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (testing, optimization, documentation)

The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs (T001-T053), parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task includes specific file paths and clear action descriptions. The implementation strategy focuses on delivering an MVP with User Story 1 first, with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities clearly identified.

# Follow-up Actions

Ready for implementation using the generated tasks. Each task can be executed independently with clear instructions and file paths.
